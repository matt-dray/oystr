Title: Handle Personal Oyster Journey History Data Provided by Transport for London
Description: You can opt-in to monthly emails from Transport for London (TfL) that
    have your Oyster journey history attached as a CSV. Functions in this small
    package help you read, wrangle and plot these data. I, and this work, are
    unaffiliated with Transport for London (TfL).
